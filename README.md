# Hand of Resources #

## Learning Objectives ##

    Create and deploy a POST endpoint that creates a resource and responds created object
    Create and deploy a GET endpoint that returns an array of objects
    Create and deploy a GET endpoint that returns a single matching object based on the id in the path and req.params.id
    Create and deploy a PUT/PATCH endpoint that updates a resource with the matching id and responds the updated object
    Create and deploy a DELETE endpoint that deletes a resource with the matching id and responds the deleted object
    Add JSON deserialization middleware and use the body in a route
    Use params to simplify the extraction of “id” from a router
    Utilize Router to implement a horizontally scalable Express App architecture
    Use the pg library with $1, $2, $3 syntax to sanitize our SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
    Use pg to make queries against a Postgres DB
    Connect to a Postgres DB using the pg node module
    Deploy an API to Heroku

## Description ##

It’s time to get some practice writing controllers, models, and tests! For this deliverable, you’ll make a single API that can create/read/update/delete five different types of resources. They don’t have to be related in any way; for example, your API could use dogs, shows, songs, games, and foods.

You need to create five different controllers, five different models, and five different test files corresponding to each resource. Create your tables using the sql/setup.sql file and npm run setup-db command. Your tables should contain at least three fields (including id). Try experimenting with different field types in Postgres.

Your test files should be added to the __tests__ directory. Each test file should be named after the resource it’s testing (e.g. __tests__/dogs.test.js). Each route for each resource needs to be tested!

Your commits need to show a vertical approach. A vertical approach means that you wrote the test, controller, and model for a single resource and committed it, rather than writing the tests for all the resources in a single commit, then all the controllers in another, etc. Make sure your commit messages are relevant and descriptive.

Finally, once you’ve built out all the routes, deploy your API to Heroku and give yourself a high five.

## Acceptance Criteria ##

    Five controller files exist for each resource
    Five model files exist for each resource
    Five test files exist for each resource
    Test pass and sufficiently cover making the request and validating the response
    Route paths follow RESTful conventions
    API is deployed to Heroku

| Task   |   |   |   | Points   |
|---       |---|---|---|---|
| Create  | test  | model  | route  | 0.5  |
| Read  | test  | model  | route  | 0.5  |
| Update  | test  | model  | route  | 0.5  |
| Delete  | test  | model  | route  | 0.5  |
| Total for 5 resources  |   |  |   | 2x5 = 10  |
| Vertical commit history  |   |  |   | 5  |
| API is RESTful  |   |  |   | 3  |
